# taxi_and_frozen_lake_rl_agents

## This is my first Reinforcement Learning agent that i had built from scratch to play FrozenLake ❄️ and taxi_service using Q-Learning.

### Q-Learning is the RL algorithm that:

Trains Q-Function, an action-value function that encoded, in internal memory, by a Q-table that contains all the state-action pair values.

Given a state and action, our Q-Function will search the Q-table for the corresponding value.

When the training is done,we have an optimal Q-Function, so an optimal Q-Table.

And if we have an optimal Q-function, we have an optimal policy, since we know for, each state, the best action to take.
